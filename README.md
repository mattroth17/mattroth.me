### (for DALI code challenge)
#### Note: used Netlify for hosting because I used SPA starter-pack from 52


[deployed url](http://mattroth.me/)

## To Run
* `git clone https://github.com/mattroth17/mattroth.me`
* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`


## Technical Tools
*  `React.js` (wasn't really necessary to use React, mainly used for easy setup and router)
*  also used frontend starter pack from CS52 (includes Webpack, Babel, eslint, Redux, and SASS but not everything was used)
  * Starterpack definitely not needed for this challenge, used it for quick/easy setup
## Languages
* JavaScript, HTML/CSS
